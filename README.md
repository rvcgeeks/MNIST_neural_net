this program illustrates the working of deep feed forward 
neural network using ardent Cpp programming and no library 
except stl abstractions ...

the preset topology uses the MNIST dataset for learning
handwritten digits ... dont worry if you dont have any of it 
as you will be asked to download the dataset in the app
if its absent and the program will extract and set it up 
on its own...

also the app saves the progress of current learnint in a '.dat'
file so it is restored automatically when you open the app next time
provided its in same local directory

PLEASE DONOT KEEP THE Knowledge .dat file of some other topology in same dir
as it may lead to bad alloc exception...


______to compile just hit g++ main.cpp and run a.out...
